# Introduction

Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Every suicide is a tragedy that affects families, communities and entire countries and has long-lasting effects on the people left behind.Hence it is quite clear that suicide is a global concern that should be analyzed. Hence, this project contains a case study, analysis and visualization of suicide rate of some countries.

## Aim

My aim of doing this project is to get insights of suicides across the countries.
## Data Cleaning

After downloading the data, I quicky realized that it needs to be cleaned in order to perform data analysis. 

First I checked for missing data and discovered there were some missing data I needed to fix which I did using pandas. I renamed some columns which were misspelt and replaced the space in the columns with underscore,I also dropped a duplicated column.
## Exploratory Analysis and Visualization

Columns analysed :

- Country        
- Year           
- Sex             
- Age               
- Suicides_no        
- Population         
- Suicides_pop     
- Gdp_for_year    
- Gdp_per_capital      
- Generation  
## Summary and Conclusion

- Russian Federation is the country with the highest number of suicides (1209742), followed by United States and then Japan.

- The Most sucides are in the late 19's and 20's, which could be possible as people are becoming more informed about suicides.

- Most common age of suicides are 35-54 years, then 55-74 years. It is probably because these ages are when people are the most stressed under various circumstances

- The sex ratio was intresting as the number of suicides of males were more than 3 times to that of women. Which goes to show that men find it difficult to cope more than women.

- There are also counties where the suicide rate is zero or even less than 50 which is really intresting.
